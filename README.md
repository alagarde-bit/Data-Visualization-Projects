Data Visualization Dashboards I create in my free time

I used my 6 pillars of data visualization:
1. Proper Chart Types
- Line charts for over time analysis
- Bar charts for frequency comparison
- Scatterplots for correlation
- Pie charts or stacked charts for percentage of a whole with few categories
- Tables for drill details
- Slicers for filtering
2. Logical Data Organization
- Grouped related metrics together
3. Efficient use of real estate
- Kept slicers on top or on the left
- Line graphs and key bar charts get more space
- Cards less space
4. Data Layering and Drill Down
- Lots of ways to drill down and see the layers for more details across pages/reports
5. Consistency in Design
- Similar formats between pages in terms of organization
- Font, slicers in similar places in top, titles in similar places in top, tables at the bottom, lines bars and scatters in the middle
6. Use of Color
- logical color choices based off categorical levels and column name
- color the same for all pages in report based on category and field
