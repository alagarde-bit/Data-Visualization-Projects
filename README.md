# Data-Visualization-Projects
Welcome to my Data Visualization Portfolio! This repository is a collection of my work focusing on transforming complex datasets into clear, engaging, and informative visualizations.
My portfolio demonstrates my ability to use various data visualization tools and technologies, including Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and more!

Data visualization dashboards I create in my free time to showcase my ability to create effective dashboards.

My 6 pillars of data visualization:
1. Proper Chart Types
- Line charts for over time
- Bar charts for frequency comparison
- Scatterplots for correlation
- Pie charts or stacked charts for percentage of a whole with few categories
- Tables for drill details
- Slicers for filtering
2. Logical Data Organization
- Group related metrics together in the same location
3. Efficient use of real estate
- Keep slicers on top or on the left
- Line graphs and key bar charts get more space
- Cards less space
4. Data Layering and Drill Down
- Press a bar in a bar chart or line in line chart and watch your dashboard interact
- Select how to filter using slicers
5. Consistency in Design
- Similar formats between pages in terms of organization
- Font, slicers in similar places in top, titles in similar places in top, tables at the bottom, lines bars and scatters in the middle
6. Use of Color
- direct eyeballs to most important aspects with proper color usage
- color the same for all pages in report based on category and field (do not change it up -keep it consistent)
